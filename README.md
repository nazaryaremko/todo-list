In this small project I created a project management application where the user can create new projects and manage tasks within each project. This exercise helped me practice creating and updating objects (making sure that when I am updating, changing or deleting anything, they stay updated), organizing my functions in different modules using webpack and making applications with tab-switching logic. To improve this project, I would also add due dats and priority indicators to the project and work on optimizing my code since in some cases I had to reuse the same piece of code and that could be avoided by breaking down functions so each one of had a single distinct role:)
